# Customize Button Size

Button size can be customized by setting `height` and `width` for the button element.

In the following sample, the height and width of the large button is customized as `50px` and `120px` and
the height and width of the small button is customized as `30px` and `25px`.

{% aspTab template="button/howto/custom-size", sourceFiles="customsize.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}

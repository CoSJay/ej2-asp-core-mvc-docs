# Animations

The toast control supports custom animations for both shows and hide actions from the provided [`animation`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Notifications.Toast.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Notifications_Toast_Animation) option of the `Animation` library.

The default animation is given as `FadeIn` for showing the toast and `FadeOut` for hiding the toast.

The following sample demonstrates some types of animations that suit toast. You can check all the animation effects here.

{% aspTab template="toast/animation", sourceFiles="controller.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}

* Supports four types of layouts: square, horizontal, vertical, and auto.
* Supports drill-down option to render data clearly in the lower level of a hierarchy.
* Supports legends and data labels for visualizing additional information on the tree map.
* Supports three types of color mapping: range, equal, and desaturation.
* Supports interactive features such as selection, highlight, tooltips, and interactive legends.

# Ribbon Resizing

When resizing the Ribbon, you have control over how the items behave in terms of their size preservation.

## Defining items allowed size

You can utilize the [allowedSizes](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Ribbon.RibbonItem.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Ribbon_RibbonItem_AllowedSizes) property to maintain a specific size for an item regardless of resizing. By configuring `allowedSizes` for an item, you restrict its size to the specified option, preserving its size even when the Ribbon is being resized.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}

@using Syncfusion.EJ2
@using Syncfusion.EJ2.Ribbon

<ejs-ribbon id="ribbon">
    <e-ribbon-tabs>
        <e-ribbon-tab header="Home">
            <e-ribbon-groups>
                <e-ribbon-group header="Clipboard">
                    <e-ribbon-collections>
                        <e-ribbon-collection>
                            <e-ribbon-items>
                                <e-ribbon-item allowedSizes=Large type="Button">
                                    <e-ribbon-buttonsettings iconCss="e-icons e-cut" content="Cut"></e-ribbon-buttonsettings>
                                </e-ribbon-item>
                            </e-ribbon-items>
                        </e-ribbon-collection>
                    </e-ribbon-collections>
                </e-ribbon-group>
            </e-ribbon-groups>
        </e-ribbon-tab>
    </e-ribbon-tabs>
</ejs-ribbon>

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Defining items active size

You can make use of the [activeSize](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Ribbon.RibbonItem.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Ribbon_RibbonItem_ActiveSize) read-only property to retrieve the size at which the item is currently being displayed.

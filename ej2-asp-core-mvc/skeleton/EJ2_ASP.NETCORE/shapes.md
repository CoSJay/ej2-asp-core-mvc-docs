# Shapes in ASP.NET Core Skeleton Control

The Skeleton control supports various built-in shape variants to design the layout of the page. You can use the [shape](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Notifications.Skeleton.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Notifications_Skeleton_Shape) property to display the skeleton in various shapes, such as circle, square, rectangle, and text and create a preview of any layout.

The Skeleton control supports the following content shapes:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/skeleton/shapes/different-shapes/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

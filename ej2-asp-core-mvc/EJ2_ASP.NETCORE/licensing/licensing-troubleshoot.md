# Syncfusion Licensing FAQ

## Is an internet connection required for Syncfusion Essential Studio license validation?

* Syncfusion license validation is done offline during application execution and does not require internet access. 

* Apps registered with a Syncfusion license key can be deployed on any system that does not have an internet connection.

## How to upgrade from trial version after purchasing a license

To upgrade from trial version,

* If you are using Syncfusion controls from [nuget.org](https:/www.nuget.org/packages?q=syncfusion), replace the currently used trial license key with a paid license key that can be generated from the [License & Downloads](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/downloads) section of our website. Refer to [this](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/aspnetcore/documentation/licensing/license-key-registration/) topic for more information regarding registering the license in the application.

N> Starting with 2022 Volume 1 v20.1.0.47, all Syncfusion customers (evaluators and paid customers) who use Syncfusion installers or nuget packages from [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Syncfusion) must generate and register the corresponding platform and version license key in your projects.<br>
For more information, please see [this](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/aspnetcore/documentation/licensing/overview) help topic

## Where can I get a license key

License keys can be generated from the [License & Downloads](https://syncfusion.com/account/downloads) or [Trial & Downloads](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/manage-trials/downloads) section of the Syncfusion website.

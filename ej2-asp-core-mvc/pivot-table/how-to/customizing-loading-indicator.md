# Customizing loading indicator

You can customize the appearance of the loading indicator in the pivot table by using the `spinnerTemplate` property. This property accepts an HTML string which can be used for appearance customization.

> You can also disable the loading indicator by setting `spinnerTemplate` to empty string.

{% aspTab template="pivot-table/loading-indicator", sourceFiles="fieldlist.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}

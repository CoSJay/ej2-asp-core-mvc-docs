# Map Providers

Maps component supports map providers such as OpenStreetMap that can be added to any layers in maps.

## Open Street Map

One of the most important features in Maps component is the built-in online map provider support. By using this feature, you can render OpenStreetMap in the maps component. This provides the ability to visualize street map tiles without using any external shape files.

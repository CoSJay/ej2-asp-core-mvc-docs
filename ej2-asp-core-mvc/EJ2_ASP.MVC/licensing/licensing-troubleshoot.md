# Licensing FAQ

## Is an internet connection required for Syncfusion Essential Studio license validation?

* Syncfusion license validation is done offline during application execution and does not require internet access. 

* Apps registered with a Syncfusion license key can be deployed on any system that does not have an internet connection.

## How to upgrade from Trial version after purchasing a license

To upgrade from trial version,

* If you are using Syncfusion controls from [nuget.org](https:/www.nuget.org/packages?q=syncfusion), replace the currently used trial license key with a paid license key that can be generated from the [License & Downloads](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/downloads) section of our website. Refer to [this](https://help.syncfusion.com/common/essential-studio/licensing/license-key#how-to-register-the-syncfusion-license-key) topic for more information regarding registering the license in the application.

N> Starting with 2022 Volume 1 v20.1.0.47, all Syncfusion customers (evaluators and paid customers) who use Syncfusion installers or nuget packages from [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Syncfusion) must generate and register the corresponding platform and version license key in your projects.<br>
For more information, please see [this](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/aspnetmvc/documentation/licensing/overview) help topic

## Where can I get a License key

License keys can be generated from the [License & Downloads](https://syncfusion.com/account/downloads) or [Trial & Downloads](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/manage-trials/downloads) section of the Syncfusion website.

Syncfusion license keys are **version and platform specific**, refer to the [KB](https://www.syncfusion.com/kb/8976/how-to-generate-license-key-for-licensed-products) to generate the license key for the required version and platform. Also, refer this [KB](https://www.syncfusion.com/kb/8951/which-version-syncfusion-license-key-should-i-use-in-my-application) to know about which version of the Syncfusion license key should be used in the application.

## Registering Syncfusion account for direct NuGet.org user

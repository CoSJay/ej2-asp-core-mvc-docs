# Filtering

Query Builder allows you to create or delete conditions and groups. You can use `ShowButtons` to enable/disable these buttons.

{% aspTab template="query-builder/filtering", sourceFiles="default.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}

You can create or delete conditions by interacting through the user interface and methods.

* Use the `addRules` and `deleteRules` methods to create/delete conditions.
* Use the `addGroups` and `deleteGroups` methods to create/delete groups.

# Getting Started

This section briefly explains about how to include a simple [Query Builder](https://www.syncfusion.com/aspnet-mvc-ui-controls/query-builder) in your ASP.NET MVC application. You can refer [ASP.NET MVC Getting Started documentation](../getting-started) page for introduction part of the system requirements and configure the common specifications.

## Add Query Builder to the project

We are going to render `Query Builder` component in **Index.cshtml** page.

{% aspTab template="query-builder/getting-started/demo", sourceFiles="default.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}

## Run the application

 After successful compilation of your application, simply press `F5` to run the application.

 The following example shows a default rendering of Query Builder.

Output be like the below.

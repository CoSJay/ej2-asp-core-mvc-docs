# Set the cursor at the specific range

This can be achieved by using `setRange` method in the Rich Text Editor using `NodeSelection` instance. In this below sample, we have passed the text node (specific location in Rich Text Editor content) in `setStart` method and passed the range in `setRange` method of Rich Text Editor.

{% aspTab template="rich-text-editor/how-to/cursor", sourceFiles="controller.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}

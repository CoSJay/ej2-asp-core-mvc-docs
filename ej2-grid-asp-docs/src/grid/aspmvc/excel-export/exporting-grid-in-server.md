# Exporting Grid in Server

The Grid have an option to export the data to Excel in server side using Grid server export library.

## Server dependencies

The Server side export functionality is shipped in the Syncfusion.EJ2.GridExport package, which is available in Essential Studio and [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/).The following list of dependencies is required for Grid server side Excel exporting action.

* Syncfusion.EJ2
* Syncfusion.EJ2.GridExport
* Syncfusion.Compression.Base
* Syncfusion.XlsIO.Base

## Server configuration

The following code snippets shows server configuration using ASP.NET MVC Controller Action.

To Export the Grid in server side, You need to call the
 [`serverExcelExport`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/grid/#serverexcelexport) method for passing the Grid properties to server exporting action.

{% aspTab template="grid/excel-export/server-export", sourceFiles="server-exportMVC.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}

> **Note:** Refer to the GitHub sample for quick implementation and testing from [here](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/MVC-EJ2-Grid-server-side-exporting).

## CSV export in server

You can export the Grid to CSV format by using the [`serverCsvExport`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/grid/#servercsvexport) method which will pass the Grid properties to server.

In the below demo, we have invoked the above method inside the [`toolbarClick`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/grid/#toolbarclick) event. In server side, we have deserialized the Grid properties and passed to the `CsvExport` method which will export the properties to CSV format.

{% aspTab template="grid/excel-export/server-csv-export", sourceFiles="server-exportMVC.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}

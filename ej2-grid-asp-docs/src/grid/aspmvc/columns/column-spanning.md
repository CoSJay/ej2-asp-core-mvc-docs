# Column Spanning

The grid has option to span the adjacent cells. You need to define the **colSpan** attribute to span cells in the [`QueryCellInfo`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Grids.Grid.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Grids_Grid_QueryCellInfo) event.

In the following demo, employee **Davolio** is doing testing from 9.00 A.M. to 10.00 A.M. so that the cells have been spanned.

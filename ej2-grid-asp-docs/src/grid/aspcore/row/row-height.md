# Row Height

You can customize the row height of grid rows through the [`rowHeight`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Grids.Grid.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Grids_Grid_RowHeight) property. The [`rowHeight`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Grids.Grid.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Grids_Grid_RowHeight) property
is used to change the row height of entire grid rows.

In the below example, the [`rowHeight`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Grids.Grid.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Grids_Grid_RowHeight) is set as '60px'.

## Customize row height for particular row

Grid row height for particular row can be customized using the [`rowDataBound`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Grids.Grid.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Grids_Grid_RowDataBound)
event by setting the [`rowHeight`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Grids.Grid.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Grids_Grid_RowHeight) in arguments for each row based on the requirement.

In the below example, the row height for the row with OrderID as '10249' is set as '90px' using the [`rowDataBound`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2.Grids.Grid.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Grids_Grid_RowDataBound) event.

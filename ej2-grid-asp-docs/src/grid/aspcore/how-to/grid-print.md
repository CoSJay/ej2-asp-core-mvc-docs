# Add a title to the header when using Grid print function

You can add your title in the header through an [`beforePrint`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/cref_files/aspnetcore-js2/Syncfusion.EJ2~Syncfusion.EJ2.Grids.Grid~beforePrint.html) event. With the help of this event you can add your title element as you want.
